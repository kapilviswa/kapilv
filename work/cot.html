<div class="content">
	<div class="wrapper-wide text"><br>
		<p>All the commercially available pet food products in the stores and online have a lot of chemicals, artificial colors, preservatives, flavor enhancers and a lot of bad fats that makes the food more tasty and unhealthy to our pets. Usually, we buy some cheap unhealthy processed food for our pets. That food often contains wastes from food industries or some leftovers from dead animal carcasses.</p>
		<p>The pet food was good back some 3 decades ago, but since the boom of the processed food, both humans and pet food have some big degenerative health problems. Visiting the vet have increased in recent times due to a lot of unknown diseases in our pets health due to poor diet.
</p>
		<p>Unlike human food, the pet's food doesn't go through extensive research to see if the product is keeping the pets healthy over a long period. There are no proper regulations in place to check it.</p>
		<p>Homemade diet for a pet is not a simple thing. It has to meet al the pet's nutritional requirements.  One has to do a lot of research for recipes that fit both the owner and the pet's needs and lifestyle.</p>

		<h2>UX Research</h2>
		<p>I created a simple survey and asked the pet owners to complete it to find the basic pain points and also to find it they buy the pet food from groceries or they are preparing a home diet for their pet. This was a good starting point and helped to streamline the problem and remove all the assumptions and guesswork.</p>
		<figure ><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/quotes.png" alt=""></figure>


		<h2>Persona</h2>
	  <p>From the survey, it was clear that there were many types of pet owners. But there was a lot of common things among all the owners. So, I created a single persona which highlights the basic pain points and needs for the MVP and kept aside all the edge cases for later use. Keep one persona helps me to focus on one user without getting distracted and start designing solution based on his/her problem.</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/persona.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>User Journey</h2>
		<p>I created a user journey for the persona based on the daily routine. This helped to determine how the user experience should be designed to fit the needs of the owners.</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/journey.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Storyboard</h2>
		<p>I love drawing and create a storyboard describing how the user might use the app. Storyboard is a great way to visualize your user and it did help me to bring me closer to the user. I created with a small narrative so it is easy to understand without any text.</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/story.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>User Flow</h2>
		<p>Mapped a basic user flow of the app that helped in figuring out the screens and number of steps that will take the user to complete some key flows.</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/flow.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
		<p>Paper sketches to visualize the flow and the screens for the app.</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/sketch.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>Converted those paper sketches into a digital version and arranged the interfaces based on the flow and added few missing screens as well. I concentrated more on the user flow and user experience more the looks for this stage. Since this is a wireframe, it easily helped me in changing and testing out new ideas.</p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/wireframes.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Colors & Typography</h2>
		<p>Went with a bright pink color as it reminds me of a newborn puppy. For the Typeface, I chose Open Sans is a free Google font and is simple. </p>
		<figure><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/colors.png" alt=""></figure>

		<h2>Prototype</h2>
		<p>The onboarding flow will collect some information about the owner's pet. This is a quick process and all the answers have 2-3 choices for the user to decide. It's like playing akinator, you just answer the question based on the choices given. At the end of the flow, we will get the necessary information about the pet for us to tailor the diet based off of it.</p>

		<figure class="boxscreenshot"><img src="../content/1-work/2-precious/gif.gif" alt=""></figure>



		<h2>What I learnt?</h2>
		<p>I spent a lot of time in the prototype since I wanted the UI to be easily liked by everyone and it should look friendly. I did a lot of online researches to find how the pet industry works and how to prepare a pet's food since I am not a pet owner. I faced a lot of challenges to create an engaging app which should be simple and should have an awesome user experience. I had very good satisfaction after completing the UI.</p>
